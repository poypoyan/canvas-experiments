Origin Shift Algorithm for Maze Generation

Video: https://youtu.be/8N1K5WU2hts

See (1) for discoverer's video and (2) for some mathematical results related to it (e.g., its relation to Aldous-Broder algorithm, another maze generation algorithm). In this variant, termination occurs when every cell is visited. This is what the pinned comment at (2) calls "the cover time". Like in Wilson's algorithm, if this terminates at all, then this outputs random spanning trees uniformly. But I notice that this is *usually* slower than Wilson's.
