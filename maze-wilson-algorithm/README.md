Wilson's Algorithm for Maze Generation Demo

It is frustrating to watch in the beginning, but Wilson's algorithm has a beautiful property that if it terminates at all, then it outputs random spanning trees uniformly. This means that this algorithm 1) doesn't produce loop pathways, and 2) doesn't have any bias (e.g on long pathways, short pathways, etc).
