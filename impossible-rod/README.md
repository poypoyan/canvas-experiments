# impossible-rod
SVG render of an impossible object I came up.

One day, just woken up from a siesta, something just came into my mind for some reason: is there an impossible object that is also self-similar? This is very interesting, and after some disorganized sketches, I came up with the rod design you'll see when you open the html file (Internet connection required; see second link below). I expected that this is infinitely self-similar. The rendered output, while still cool, is not, unfortunately. I tried modifying the parameters, but still no luck.

I believe that this is possible though, hence I ask the question in Math.SE which describes the situation more in terms of equations. Answering must involve modifying `prop_dec()` and `qrop_dec()` in the html file, or a proof of impossibility.

Nevertheless, I hope to see other designs for self-similar (whether it's "finite" like the output here or true infinite) impossible objects in general (e.g. using angles different from the output here, knots/links, curves, etc).
